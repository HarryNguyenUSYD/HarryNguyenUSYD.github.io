# Overloading

Let's say you are making a simple function that takes in an integer and print it out with some extra message:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`void printInt(int input) {
    Console.WriteLine("You typed in integer: " + input);
}`}
/>

This is simple, it takes in an integer and print out a line. Now let's say you want to make something like this, but for strings:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`void printString(string? input) {
    Console.WriteLine("You typed in string: " + input);
}`}
/>

Great. And now let's make one for floats:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`void printFloat(float input) {
    Console.WriteLine("You typed in float: " + input);
}`}
/>

Notice how all of these functions have similar functionality, but you have to remember the correct name to use it with your
desired input (you can't use `printInt` with `"Hello"`)? Luckily, C# does have a way to let you keep the same name for all of those functions. This is called
overloading.

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`void print(int input) {
    Console.WriteLine("You typed in integer: " + input);
}

void print(string? input) {
    Console.WriteLine("You typed in string: " + input);
}

void print(float input) {
    Console.WriteLine("You typed in float: " + input);
}

// Try them!
print(1);
print("Hello");
print(0.2f);`}
/>
