# Welcome Back!

Hello everyone, and welcome back to my series "Absolute Basics", where we explore everything you need to know to write the best code possible.

So, with all the programming language discussions we had last week, let's get into the juicy part of writing your first lines of code today. We will be
using Python since (a) it is one of the easiest languages to learn, and (b) it is also the language my uni chooses to teach beginners.

We will go over installing Python as well as an IDE. After that, we will talk about some of the basic aspects of Python, in order to pave way for more
complex topics in the coming weeks. I'll try to explain everything in as much detail as possible, as if you have zero technological experience whatsoever
(after all, not everyone reading this wants to become a programmer).

This episode will be a long one. So without further ado, let's jump right into it.

# Installing Your Toolbox

## Python

Python can be installed from the language's website <Redirect name="here" url="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3135/" />. As of writing this
blog, Python's newest version is Python 3.13.5, but any 3.X.X version will be practically the same. Note that different operating systems have
different installers, so get one based on your device.

> Note: For this guide, we will be using the Windows version. That said, Python will behave exactly the same on any operating system, so don't worry about
that.

    alt={`All the versions of Python 3.13.5. If you are using Windows, pick the "Windows installer (64-bit)" one.`}    
/>

Once installed, click on the installer to begin.

    alt={`The starting screen of the Python installer`}    
/>

> IMPORTANT: Make sure to tick the "Add python.exe to PATH" option if you are a Windows user.

Click on "Install Now". Wait for the program to finish, and that's it.

## VSCode

Before we start coding, we have to talk about code editors. Code editors are practically text editors designed for writing and editing source code, think of
them as Microsoft Word for programming. Code editors have many features that help you program more easily, such as syntax highlighting, autocomplete,
extensions and plugins, etc. Practically, they are a necessity for every programmer.

You may also come across something known as IDEs. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, and they are essentially code editors on steroids. They
include all the features of code editors, plus build and debug tools that helps streamline your work, but they are very heavy to install and slow to use
for small projects, especially those for beginners.

For most programming intents and purposes, I recommend using VS Code, which is a free, open-source code editor made by Microsoft. VS Code has all the features
I listed above for code editors, as well as built-in terminals (which will be very necessary), a library of community extensions and themes, as well as being
lightweight and simple to use.

VS Code can be installed from Microsoft's website <Redirect name="here" url="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" />. Again, different operating systems
have a different installer, so get one based on your device.

/>

> IMPORTANT: Make sure to tick all the four "Others" option on the second page if you are a Windows user.

# Let's Get Started

## Setting Up A New Folder

Once you are done installing everything, open VS Code. On the top left corner, go to `File > Open Folder...`, then create an empty folder and click on it.
Then, click the "Select Folder" button. If done right, you will be in an empty project.

<SingleImage
    url="blogs/programming-2"
    src="new-project.png"
    width={419}
    height={264}
/>

In the blank area on the left, right-click and select `New File...`. Name the new file `hello_world.py`.

<SingleImage
    url="blogs/programming-2"
    src="new-file.png"
    width={518}
    height={563}
/>

One last step. On the top left bar, go to `Terminal > New Terminal`. This will create a terminal on the bottom of your screen.

<SingleImage
    url="blogs/programming-2"
    src="new-terminal.png"
    width={410}
    height={462}
/>

If everything is done correctly, your screen should look like this. Notice the terminal at the bottom of the screen.
Don't worry if yours is not the same as mine, everything should work exactly the same.

## Hello, World!

Now that we have gotten all the boring parts out of the way, let's start writing our first Python program. In the new `hello_world.py` file, type in this
line:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`print("Hello, World!")`}
    copiable={true}
/>

Hmmm, I wonder what that function do? Save the file, then go to the terminal and type:

<CodeBlock
    language="bash"
    code={`python hello_world.py`}
    copiable={true}
/>

This command uses Python to run the file. Another line will appear on the terminal as the output, which should read:

<CodeBlock
    language="bash"
    code={`$ python hello_world.py
Hello, World!`}
/>

> Try changing the text between the quotation marks to something else. What does it print now?

That's it! You have written your first program using Python. You may feel a bit underwhelming, that's fine, since we have barely scratched the Python
surface.

Our first program said hello to the world, but what if it can say hello to you instead? To do so, it needs to know your name, and you, being a generous owner,
can type your name into it.

Change the content of the file into this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name)`}
    copiable={true}
/>

The first line creates a variable `name`, and set its value to whatever you type in (we call this `input`, contrast to `output` which is what the program
prints out). Then, we print the world `Hello` plus that variable, making a message customizable to your name.

Save the file and run the `python hello_world.py` command again. The output should look like this (assuming your name is "Joe"):

<CodeBlock
    language="bash"
    code={`$ python hello_world.py
What's your name? Joe
Hello, Joe`}
/>

> Again, try changing the text between the quotation marks to something else. You can also add a plus sign `+` to the `print` function and keep adding
text to it like this: `print("Hello, " + name + ", how are you?")`

Great! Now you know how to get input from the user!

# Let's Talk About Variables

## No, Not The Math Ones

Yes, variables do exist in programming, but with a much different meaning. Variables are essentially data containers, and they are used so you can
access them later during your code. As a container, it can be reused and its content reassigned, but you can't really change its name.

Before using a variable, you have to declare it. As you can see from our previous program, you can define a variable in Python using this statement:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`<variable_name> = <starting_value>`}
/>

The name of the variable can be anything you want, but there are some rules you have to follow. These are:

- No spaces
- Must start with either a letter or an underscore `_`.
- Case sensitive, i.e. 'X' is different from 'x'
- Cannot use reserved keywords and Python's base functions as variable names (e.g. `def`, `print`, `input`), but you can use them as part of a
name (e.g. `print_more`)

Also, for Python programs, it is generally considered good practice to name your variables using `snake_case`, where every word is lowercased and connected
using an underscore `_`. Constants are written with capitalized words instead (e.g. `CONST_VAL`).

## "A Number's A Number, But A Variable Could Be Anything. It Could Even Be A Number!"

In Python (and most other languages), every variable belongs to a type. Since Python is a dynamically-typed language, you don't need to declare the
type of variable during initialization, much different from statically-typed languages like Java or C/C++. That being said, you should know how 
variable types work under the hood, so you can understand why you can or can't do some things in Python.

Every time you create something in Python (a variable, a function, etc.), you essentially create an **object**. Objects are blocks of memory that contain
related data and associated operations for that data. Every object also has a type, which gives you a hint into what operations you can do with that data.
For instance, two objects of type `int` can be multiplied with each other, but two objects of type `string` cannot. As a programmer, you can create new
object and object types, as well as defining their operations. We will talk about this in later weeks.

For now, let's focus on the main object types you will mostly use in Python. These are:

<Table
    id="variable_types"
    columns={["Name", "Meaning", "Examples"]}
    content={[
        ["int", "Integers (Whole numbers)", "0, 1, 9999, -3131"],
        ["float", "Floating-point numbers", "6.9, 3.14, -1.414, 5.12e3"],
        ["bool", "Boolean values", "True, False"],
        ["string", "Strings (text)", `"abc", "Hello, World!", ""`],
    ]}
/>

You can know the type of an object using the command `type(<object>)`. For instance:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`a = "Hello"
b = 999
c = 0.5
d = True

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))`}
    copiable={true}
/>

The output will be:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'bool'>`}
/>

## A Deeper Analysis

Let's take a closer look at each of these data types individually.

- `int`s are integers. They can be positive or negative, and includes 0. In Python, `int` can be arbitrarily big or small.
- `float`s are floating-point numbers, used to represent decimal numbers. `float` can cover a wider range of numbers, but they are less accurate.
- `string`s are text of any length. They can contain alphanumerical characters and symbols. Note that an empty string `""` is still a string.
- `bool`s are boolean values, which are either `True` or `False`.

`int` and `float` can be used to do mathematical expressions with each other. If the result is a decimal number, it will automatically be changed to `float`
type. Common mathematical operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (whole division), `**` (power), and `%` (modulo).

`string`s can be concatenated with each other using the `+` symbol (e.g. `"ab" + "cd" = "abcd"`). They can also be multiplied with an integer to repeat
the string that many times (e.g. `"abc" * 3 = "abcabcabc"`).

## Spel... I Mean Type Casting

Sometimes you will need to convert an object of type A to type B. For instance, getting input from the user using `input()` will only return strings,
but what if you need to get a number?

Each of the basic variable types above has a corresponding function to cast other objects to its type (if possible). These are:

<Table
    id="variable_casting"
    columns={["Variable", "Function"]}
    content={[
        ["int", `int()`],
        ["float", `float()`],
        ["bool", `bool()`],
        ["string", `str()`],
    ]}
/>

You can convert a type to another like so:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`a = "123"

print(a, type(a))

b = int(a)

print(b, type(b))`}
    copiable={true}
/>

The output will be:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`123 <class 'str'>
123 <class 'int'>`}
/>

Notice how they don't look so different in print, but their types has changed. This is because every type is converted to `string` right before printing.

Also, be careful when using these functions. If you try to use a cast function in a way that doesn't make sense (e.g. `int("abc")`), Python will throw an
error. The best way to avoid this is by using `try` - `except` statements, but we will get to them in later weeks.

# Conclusion

And that's it for now. We have downloaded Python and VS Code, wrote some introductory programs, and learnt some new concepts about variables, objects, and
data types. While this episode is still quite basic, it does give us a foundation to write more complex codes in the upcoming weeks.

soon as I can. For now, have fun learning!
