# Welcome to a new series

Welcome to the first instalment of my new "Introduction to .NET" series (which is also the first Guide series on this site!), where I will guide you
through everything you need to know to start your first .NET project (and/or land your interview 20 minutes from now). For this episode, we will talk
briefly about the history of .NET, what .NET is composed of,

# What is .NET?

## "DLL Hell"

So back in the olden days of the year 2000, developing Windows applications required a wide range of tools that, surprisingly, did not work well with
each other. C/C++ with Win32 API was the most commonly used back-end languages, combined with ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) for database connection,
and Active Server Pages (ASP) for web applications. For GUI development, Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) or Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) are used.
These tools and languages are then connected together using Component Object Model (COM), which was later extended into DCOM, then combined with
Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) to become COM+.

The trouble is, each of these tools and languages has tons of limitations that made them difficult to work with: C/C++ required manual memory management
and steep learning curve; Classic ASP had a variety of security issues that caused some notable incidents, including the Download.ject attack in 2004;
MFC and VB6 were too complex for simple tasks and lacked structured exception handling, just to name a few. But the most significant problem with all of
these tools was their dependence on COM and its variants as a "glue", and that led to plenty of issues around Windows development at that time.

The most infamous of those issues were .dll files. DLLs, or Dynamic Link Libraries, are files that contain reusable code, data, and resources that can
be shared across multiple programs on Windows. Most of the tools listed above would have one or more of these, as well as any extra software or other
tools you need to work with. DLLs were great for their purpose: they enables reusable code and runtime loading, they help with separating components,
and most importantly, they allow developers to extend the functionality of existing applications without modifying their core codebase. However, all .dll
files have a major problem regarding versioning, specifically because DLLs were only identified by their file names and not by version number,
build date, or signature. Installing a new DLL, even with changes, would silently overwrote an older version, meaning other applications depending on the
original version would often crash or behave unpredictably. This was amplified by the fact that DLLs were frequently installed into the System32 source
directory (e.g. C:\Windows\System32), and that multiple applications shared the same copy of a DLL. This would lead to a phenomenon known as "DLL Stomping",
where a newly installed application overwrites an existing DLL with an earlier or incompatible version.

This issue gave rise to the term "DLL Hell", a term that symbolises the problems developers may face when dealing with DLLs in older Windows system. These
problems manifest themshelves in many ways, such as programs suddenly not working correctly, or would not run at all. Developers would spend hours tracking
down what went wrong, only to realise that the DLLs they were using has been replaced with a wrong version at some point. And since every application has
their own copies of .dll files, and most projects need to use dozens of applications, it is easy to understand the frustration every Windows developer of the
era had to went through.

## Here Comes a New Challenger!

To deal with all of those issues, as well as to compete against the rise of Java as a platform for web and enterprise applications, Microsoft began to
develop a framework called Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS), which was later known as .NET. The project began in the late 1990s, and the first beta
version of the framework was released in late 2001. Over the years and across many updates, .NET has proven itself to be a powerful open-source,
cross-platform developer platform for building modern applications for the web, desktop, mobile, cloud, gaming, IoT, and a lot more.

Being a platform, .NET has multiple components,
