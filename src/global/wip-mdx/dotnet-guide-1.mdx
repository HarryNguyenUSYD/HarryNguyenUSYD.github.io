# Welcome To a New Series!

Welcome to the first instalment of my new "Introduction to .NET" series (the first Guide series on this site!), where I will walk you through everything
you need to know about starting your first .NET project (and/or land your interview 20 minutes from now). For this episode, we will talk
about how .NET began, what .NET is made up of, and why .NET is better than any of its competitors.

Since our topic of discussion today requires a lot of technological terms and concepts, I would recommend to only read this series if you
are an intermediate/advanced member of the coding field. For beginners, don't worry, there will be another series for you tackling all the basic knowledge
you need to start programming.

Without further ado, let's begin with every old programmer's nightmare.

# "DLL Hell"

So back in the olden days of the early 2000s, developing Windows applications required a wide range of tools that, surprisingly, did not work well with
each other. C/C++ with Win32 API was the most commonly used back-end languages, combined with ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) for database connection,
and Active Server Pages (ASP) for web applications. For GUI development, Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) or Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) are used.
These tools and languages are then connected together using Component Object Model (COM), which was later extended into DCOM, then combined with
Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) to become COM+.

The trouble is, each of these tools and languages has tons of limitations that made them difficult to work with: C/C++ required manual memory management
and a steep learning curve; Classic ASP had a variety of security issues that caused some notable incidents, including the Download.ject attack in 2004;
MFC and VB6 were too complex for simple tasks and lacked structured exception handling, just to name a few. But the most significant problem with all of
these tools was their dependence on COM and its variants as a "glue", and that led to plenty of issues around Windows development at that time.

The most infamous of those issues were `.dll` files. DLLs, or Dynamic Link Libraries, are files that contain reusable code, data, and resources that can
be shared across multiple programs on Windows. Most of the tools listed above would have one or more of these, as well as any extra software or other
tools you need to work with. When a developer writes a class that implements one or more COM interfaces, that code will be compiled into a `.dll` file.
The DLL is then registered in the Windows Registry, which maps each COM class to the its file path, allowing COM to find and load it.

DLLs were great for their purpose: They enable reusable code and runtime loading, they help with separating components,
and most importantly, they allow developers to extend the functionality of existing applications without modifying the core codebase. However, all `.dll`
files have a major problem regarding versioning, specifically because DLLs were only identified by their file names and not by version number,
build date, or signature. Installing a new DLL, even with changes, would silently overwrote an older version, causing other applications using the
original version to crash or behave unpredictably. This was amplified by the fact that DLLs were frequently installed into the System32 directory
(e.g. `C:\Windows\System32`), and that multiple applications shared the same copy of a DLL. This would lead to a phenomenon known as "DLL Stomping",
where a newly-installed application overwrites an existing DLL with an earlier, incompatible version.

This issue gave rise to the term "DLL Hell", a term that symbolises the problems developers may face when dealing with DLLs in older Windows systems. These
problems manifest themselves in many ways, such as programs suddenly not working correctly, or would not run at all. Developers would spend hours tracking
down what went wrong, only to realise that the DLLs they were using has been replaced with a wrong version at some point. And since each application has
its own copies of `.dll` files, and most projects need to use dozens of applications, it is easy to understand the frustration every Windows developer of the
era had to go through.

To deal with all of those issues, as well as to compete against the rise of Java as a platform for web and enterprise applications, Microsoft began to
develop a framework called Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS), which became later known as .NET. The project began in the late 1990s, with the first
beta version released in late 2001. Over the years and across many updates, .NET has proven itself to be a powerful open-source, cross-platform developer
platform for building modern applications, with the newest version (as of writing this blog) being .NET 9.

# An anatomical view of .NET

As a platform, .NET has a long list of components that keep getting changed every releases. That said, there are some components that are vital for
every project. These can be installed all at once as the <Redirect name=".NET SDK" url="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download" />, which includes:

- Compilers for .NET languages (C#, F# and VB.NET).
- MSBuild, the project build engine, responsible for compiling, resolving references, transforming assets, etc.
- .NET Class Library, also known as the .NET API, consisting of the `System` namespace, types, data structures, and many internal APIs.
These are the developers' main access point to the .NET platform.
- NuGet, the .NET package manager. It allows .NET projects to get external dependencies without downloading DLLs manually.
- .NET CLI, a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications. It consists of the dotnet driver, commands, and
optional arguments.

<CodeBlock
    language="bash"
    alt="A sample usage of .NET CLI (source: .NET CLI overview by Microsoft)"
    code={`dotnet new console
dotnet build --output ./build_output
dotnet ./build_output/my_app.dll`}
/>

There are also a wide variety of app models that can be used with .NET. These includes:

- ASP.NET: A framework for building web apps and services.
- .NET MAUI: A front-end framework to build native, cross-platform desktop and mobile apps.
- Windows Desktop: Includes Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms, which are GUI frameworks built on top of .NET
for creating Windows desktop applications.

All in all, .NET is a massive ecosystem for developers, suitable not just for Windows but also for web, mobile, and cloud development.

# A Massive Fish in the C(#)

With all that being said, .NET is not the only development platform on the market. As mentioned earlier, .NET was partly created to compete against the rise
of Java, and that is still one of .NET's most popular competitors. That is not to mention many smaller cross-platform frameworks that were created after
.NET and are rapidly gaining popularity, such as Node.js, Flutter, React Native, etc.

So why should you learn .NET? One of the greatest reasons why you should learn a new framework is how popular it is within your field (because chances are,
the company you work for will choose the framework for you). .NET is continuously being used and adapted in multiple fields, companies, and enterprises, including,
but not limited to:

- Banking, finance, and insurance: Bank of America, TD Ameritrade, Allianz, etc.
- Government and public sector: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, UK Government Digital Service, Australian Department of Health, etc.
- E-commerce and retail: Vodafone, Uber, Michelin, etc.
- Software and SaaS vendors: Stack Overflow, JetBrains Rider IDE, etc.

> Tip: If you would like to work for a certain company, check if they are using .NET. Maybe that will be useful if they are hiring.

There are many reasons why .NET is so popular.

Firstly, .NET is free, open-source, and is regularly given official updates. For longevity, .NET is one of the safest bets out there.

Secondly, .NET provides a comprehensive, cross-platform, high-performance, and developer-friendly environment for building modern applications. It is one
of the most well-documented frameworks, it is simple to learn and use, and it has the most powerful language support of C#, F# and VB.

Thirdly, .NET is backed by Microsoft, who has been a technological giant for the past few decades. Some enterprises have adopted their technology from the
very beginning, and emerging companies still see Microsoft's popularity as a proof of quality.

And finally, even if you don't use .NET directly, some tools or frameworks you are using will most likely have it as a core part. Examples include Unity (game engine),
SciSharp (Machine learning and AI), and Umbraco CMS (open-source CMS). That is to show how prevalent .NET is in the market.

# Conclusion

So, are you sold on picking up .NET yet? If not, I can't help you. If yes, stay tuned for the next episode where we will take a first look at how to get start
with your first .NET program.
