# Programming 101

Welcome to the first instalment of a series titled "Absolute Basics", where we talk about the most fundamental knowledge that everyone who does
programming (not necessarily programmers!) has to know. This series will cover a variety of topics, such as the meaning of programming, version control,
programming best practices, etc. If you are someone who is looking to work in IT or has to program in some capcity in your work, this series is designed
for you.

Without further ado, let's dive into the definition of programming, how programming used to work, and what sort of things you need to think about for your
first program.

# NameError: name 'Programming' is not defined

Let's start with the simple question: What is programming? To answer that question, we need to know what a program is. According to the IEEE Standard
Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, a computer program is: "A combination of computer instructions and data definitions that enable computer
hardware to perform computational or control functions". In simpler terms, it is a set of steps that a computer follows precisely to do something.

Everything a computer does is part of a program. Turning your computer on requires it to run an initializing program. Your operating system (such as
Windows, MacOS or Linux) is a system of programs that manage files, memory, and devices. Everything you do on your computer is just you running one or
multiple programs. Even when you are leaving your computer on idle, there are plenty of background programs continuously being run, such as the ones
monitoring your inputs or refreshing your screen.

Programming, by extension, is the act of writing a program. A programmer is someone who is responsible for designing, developing, and (mostly) debuging
programs.
