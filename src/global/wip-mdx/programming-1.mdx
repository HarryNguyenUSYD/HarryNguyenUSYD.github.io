# Programming 101

Welcome to the first instalment of a series titled "Absolute Basics", where we talk about the most fundamental knowledge that everyone who does
programming (not necessarily programmers!) has to know. This series will cover a variety of topics, such as the meaning of programming, version control,
programming best practices, etc. If you are someone who is looking to work in IT or has to program in some capcity in your work, this series is designed
for you.

Today, we will dive into the definition of programming, how programming started, different categories of programming languages, and what programming
language you might want to learn for your first program. Note that we will not dive into writing your first program in this episode, rather leaving it
for the next one in the series, so stay tuned for that!

This episode is a long one, but I hope the information will be more than usefull for your first steps into coding. Without further ado, let's get straight
into it!

# NameError: name 'Programming' is not defined

Let's start with the simple question: What is programming? To answer that question, we need to know what a program is. According to the IEEE Standard
Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, a computer program is: "A combination of computer instructions and data definitions that enable computer
hardware to perform computational or control functions". In simpler terms, it is a set of steps that a computer follows precisely to do something.

Everything a computer does is part of a program. Turning your computer on requires it to run an initializing program. Your operating system (such as
Windows, MacOS or Linux) is a system of programs that manage files, memory, and devices. Everything you do on your computer is just you running one or
multiple programs, e.g. browing the web with Google Chrome, writing a document with Microsoft Word, etc. Even when you are leaving your computer on idle,
there are still plenty of background programs continuously being run, such as the ones monitoring your inputs or refreshing your screen.

Programming, by extension, is the act of writing a program. A programmer is someone who is responsible for designing, developing, and (mostly) debuging
programs. We also refer to those actions as coding, and the files programmers work on are called code. That being said, programming can be done by any body,
not just programmers. Scientists, engineers, and many more occupations write code regularly to automate their workflow all the time, using all sort of tools
and programming languages.

Nowadays, professional programmers (also known as developers) is one of the most popular jobs titles on the market, with demands continuing to grow despite
the massive growth of AI that can write huge programs in the matter of minutes. Programming is also no longer just limited to nerds who can afford college
tuition, since everyone can now learn to code using a wide range of resources available online for free (such as this one!).

# Before There Was Programming, There Was Programmable Devices

Programming started as, and has always been, a method of automating repeated tasks. The first known programmable device was an automated mechanical flute
player from the 9th century, described in a book titled "Book of Ingenious Devices". Later, in 1206, a programmable drum machine was invented by the
Arab engineer Al-Jazari that could play different rhythms and drum patterns. These devices have mechanisms that allow them to be customizable, meaning
a user can change the configuation to make the machines behaves differently, perhaps playing a different song.

But the most notable pre-computer programmable device has to be the Jacquard machine: a device invented in 1801 that, when fitted to a loom,
automates the weaving of textiles with customizable complex patterns. The pattern is encoded using a series of laced punchcards,
each being a rectangular piece of stiff paper with holes punched in specific positions. Each card represents one row in the textile, and each hole on the
card represents the loom lifting a corresponding thread in a certain position. This device was irreplacable for the job, being able to consistently weave
repeatable, complex, and programmable patterns. More importantly, it inspired the invention of later computing devices, such as early computers like
ENIAC and IBM tabulators.

While programmable devices was created much sooner in history, the first so-called computer program was only created in 1843 by Ada Lovelace. Ada Lovelace
was a mathematician, and her program was an algorithm for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, designed to run on the Charles Babbage's Analytical
Engine. She was also the first person to believe that computers can be way more powerful than just doing math, saying:

> "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform."

But it wasn't until the 1930s did one of the most foundational figures of programming emerge, a man by the name of Alan Turing. He was a British
mathematician, logician, computer scientist, and more importantly, the creator of the Turing Machine, consisting of: an infinitely long tape divided into
cells, a tape head (reader) that reads and writes symbols, a finite set of rules (the program) that tell it what to do based on its current state and
the symbol under the head. This was the first formal mathematical definition of a computer, using which he established the field of computability theory,
studying what problems can or cannot be solved by a computer. Turing also proposed a design for the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first
stored-program computers, and he was also the father of the Turing Test: a way to evaluate whether a machine can "think" by seeing if it can imitate
human responses in conversation.

> Protip: Check out the recreation of Alan Turing's work in "The Imitation Game" (2014) on Netflix!

In modern days, computers have been made to fit into spaces as small as your pockets, and its computing capacity is practically limitless. Computers and
programming has made its way into every aspect of life, from leisure to business to governments, way further than its humble origin of songs and textiles.

# The Different Types of Programming Languages

Modern programming has gone way past the need to code Turing Machine instructions line-by-line to feed into a computer. Nowadays, there are multiple
"languages" that are designed to be human-readable, while also being able to be easily transformed (compiled) into machine-readable code. These are known
as programming languages.

There are tens of hundreds of programming languages, each serving a different purpose, or is used for a different part of a system. It is very common
for projects to have multiple programming languages being used, and for each developer to know tens of languages for different needs.

Since there are so many programming languages, there are also many different ways to categorize them.

One way is by level of abstraction, which is how close or far the language is to machine code. Low-level languages (e.g. C, Rust, Assembly) are closer to
machine code, and include features like manual memory management and direct interact with CPU, memory, and registers. Programs written using them are
faster and more light-weight, but takes much longer time to develop and more difficult to learn. On the other hand, high-level languages (e.g. Python,
Java, JavaScript) are farther from machine code, and include features like automatic memory management (garbage collector) and built-in libraries
which abstracts hardware interactions. Since they are the opposite of low-level languages, programs written using them are slower, bulkier, but is faster
to develop and easier to learn.

Another way is by paradigm, which is the style or philosophy of programming the language takes. A language can have one or multiple paradigms. Imperative
languages wants you to describes how to perform tasks step by step (e.g. C, Python, Java), while declarative languages wants you to describes what to do, not
how to do it (e.g. SQL, Haskell). Procedural languages are based on procedures/functions (e.g. C, Pascal, Fortran), while Object-Oriented (OOP) languages
are based on classes and objects (e.g. Java, C++, Python). Picking up a language can be easier if you know another language with the same paradigm, so pay
attention to the properties of your starting one.

And lastly, languages are most commonly categoried by use type. Different languages are designed for different specific purposes. Web developers mostly
use JavaScript, TypeScript, or PHP. Data scientists use mostly Python, R, or Julia. Game developers mostly use C++, C#, Lua, or GDScript. So on and so
forth. Some languages, however, are general-purpose, meaning it can do anything. Examples of these include Python, Java, and C++.

# Choose Your Starter Poke... I Mean Programming Language

Every programmer begins with a starting programming language. While different languages aren't strong against any another (and your rival most likely
isn't going to pick something that counters yours), picking a good starting language is still important, since it becomes a bridge to help you learn other
languages.

A good starting language should accomplish three things:

1. It is general-purpose, so you can build a lot of things with it.
2. It may or may not be easy to learn, but you can learn a lot of things from it.
3. It is commonly used in the job market, so you can become proficient with it early and start your career sooner.

That being said, there are three candidates I recommend for you first language:

## Python

Python is arguably the easiest of the three, and one of the easiest language to learn in general. Python:

- is dynamically-typed, so you don't have to worry about data types early on.
- has very simple syntax
- is object-oriented.
- is one of the most popular languages on the market, especially in data science, web, and AI.

On the other hand, Python:

- doesn't help you to familiarize with data types, which is important for other languages.
- doesn't give low-level access to memory or hardware, so you can't learn to manage memory efficiently.
- has very slow performance compared to other languages.

Python is the best option if you don't do programming very often, or if you want something easy to learn for your first project.

<CodeBlock language="python" code="print('Hello, World!')" alt='A Python code snippet that prints "Hello, World!"' />

## Java

Java is slightly harder than Python, in exchange for better educational value. Java:

- is statically-typed, meaning you have to pay attention to data types, allowing you to learn other languages easier.
- is object-oriented.
- is excellent for cross-platform applications.
- is commonly used for Android Applications development.

On the other hand, Java:

- is very verbose, meaning you need to write a lot of things for simple functions.
- has a steep learning curve.
- also has slow performance (but better than Python).

Java is the best option if you want to build something big, or if you want to learn efficient Object-Oriented Programming.

<CodeBlock language="java" code={`public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}`} alt='A Java code snippet that prints "Hello, World!"' />

## C++

C++ is the hardest of the three, but it is very commonly used for competitive programming due to its speed, as well as having great educational value. C++:

- is statically-typed like Java.
- is object-oriented, but not strictly necessary like Java.
- is low-level, making it very fast and allows you to learn low-level programming concepts like memory management and pointers.
- is widely used in many fields, e.g. game development, finance, robotics, embedded systems.

On the other hand, C++:

- has unconventional syntax, so a lot of things you write in C++ you will rarely see in other languages.
- is much more difficult to learn due to it being low-leveled.
- in terms of building projects, C++ is the slowest of the three.

C++ is the best option if you want to code competitively, or if you want to start learning low-level languages.

<CodeBlock language="cpp" code={`#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}`} alt='A C++ code snippet that prints "Hello, World!"' />

# Conclusion

So, with all of that in mind, pick a language that's best for you. Keep in mind that if you want to become a professional developer, chances are you will
have to learn all three of those above at some point, as well as many more. Be patient, keep on learning, and you will become a programming expert in no
time.
