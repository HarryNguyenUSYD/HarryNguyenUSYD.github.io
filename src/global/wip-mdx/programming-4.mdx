# Welcome Back!

Hello everyone and welcome back to the 4th episode of my Absolute Basics series, where we discuss everything you need to know to become a good programmer.
This week, we will talk about conditionals, which is how machines are able to change its execution depending on certain conditions (hence the name). This
is an important topic that will be useful for any computer program, including Python.

If, you want to know more about last week's topic - functions and Python's flow of execution, feel free to check it out

Else, let's get straight into it!

# Truth-y Statements

## True or False?

The idea of conditionals is simple: do something if a condition is met. These sorts of decision making happen even in our daily life, such as buying
bananas if they are on discount, or bring an umbrella if it's raining outside. In programming, we encode the conditions (e.g. bananas on discount or raining
outside) using boolean variables.

Boolean variables only have two possible values: `True` or `False`. We use these variables to show if a condition is met or not. For example, a boolean
variable is `True` if bananas are on discount, and `False` if they aren't. Since boolean variables only have two possible states, we only use each of them
to encode one condition. If there are multiple conditions (e.g. we only buy bananas if they are on discount AND we have money), we encode each of the
conditions using one boolean variable, and combine them using logical operators.

There are three basic logical operators: AND (`and` in Python), OR (`or`), and NOT (`not`). We can use these to combine or change the values of boolean
variables.

- AND: The result will be True only if both a and b is True.
- OR: The result will be True if either a or b (or both) is True.
- NOT: The result will be True if either a is False, and otherwise.

How these operators work with variables can be summarized using a "truth table", such as these below:

<Table
    columns={["a", "b", "a and b"]}
    content={[
        ["True", "True", "True"],
        ["True", "False", "False"],
        ["False", "True", "False"],
        ["False", "False", "False"]
    ]}
/>

<Table
    columns={["a", "b", "a or b"]}
    content={[
        ["True", "True", "True"],
        ["True", "False", "True"],
        ["False", "True", "True"],
        ["False", "False", "False"]
    ]}
/>

<Table
    columns={["a", "not a"]}
    content={[
        ["True", "False"],
        ["False", "True"]
    ]}
/>

## From Comparison To Condition

In Python, boolean values are stored in `boolean` type variables. Conditionals in Python revolve around these statements to be used. However, using just
boolean values to code isn't the greatest idea. That's why Python, and most programming languages, has ways to convert other types of data to boolean values
as well.

The simplest way of doing this is via comparison. In Python, we have access to comparison operators. These are:

<Table
    columns={["Name", "Symbol"]}
    content={[
        ["Greater", ">"],
        ["Greater or Equal", ">="],
        ["Lower", "<"],
        ["Lower or Equal", "<="],
        ["Equal", "=="],
        ["Not Equal", "!="],
    ]}
/>

> Note: The Equal operator has two equal signs to differentiate it from the assign operator (e.g. `a = 2` vs `a == 2`).

We can use these to convert variables of any kind to boolean values, provided they can be compared with each other. For example:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`a = 10
b = 20

print(a < 15)     # Prints True
print(b >= 25.15) # Prints False
print(a < b)      # Prints True`}
/>

Strings can also be compared with each other. `==` can be used to check if two strings are the same, `!=` if two strings are different,
and the rest can be used to see which one comes first alphabetically. For example:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`a = "Hello"
b = "World"

print(a == "Hello")  # Prints True
print(a != b)        # Prints True
print(a < b)         # Prints True (because "H" is before "W" alphabetically)`}
/>

Another method of conversion is by using the `bool()` function. This function allows Python to convert any object to its boolean value equivalent.

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`a = 0
b = bool(a)

print(b) # Prints False`}
/>

This gave rise to the concept of "truthy" and "falsy" statements in Python. Any statement in Python that can be converted to `True` is a truthy statement,
and those that convert to `False` is a falsy one. Explaining in detail how these work is really long (and honestly, boring), so if you are interested,

# if (you_love_me == True): let_me_go()

## The 3 Keywords

Python's implementation of conditionals is based around three main keywords: `if`, `else`, and `elif`.

`if` is simple: do something **if** something is true. We can make an `if`-statement using this syntax:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`if (<condition>):
    <do_something>`}
/>

For instance, say you want to print a message if the user is older than 18:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`age = int(input("How old are you (years)? "))

if (age >= 18):
    print("You are an adult!")`}
/>

If you want to do something else when the `if` condition is False, you can use an `else`-statement, which extends the `if`:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`age = int(input("How old are you (years)? "))

if (age >= 18):
    print("You are an adult!")
else:
    print("Not yet!")`}
/>

Sometimes, you want to do something if A happens, or something else if B happens. We can do this by combining `if` and `else` into an `else if`-statement,
or use Python's shorthand, `elif`:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`age = int(input("How old are you (years)? "))

if (age >= 18):
    print("You are an adult!")
elif (age <= 12):
    print("You are a child!")
else:
    print("You are a teenager")`}
/>

## Combining Conditions

As mentioned earlier, boolean variables can be combined using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`). For instance, if you want to buy a beer in Australia,
you have to be 18 or above, and have enough money (say, 5 dollars). In Python, we can encode it like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`age = int(input("How old are you? "))
money = int(input("How many dollars do you have? "))

if (age >= 18 and money >= 5):
    print("Cheers, mate!")
elif (age < 18):
    print("Give it a couple years")
else: # The only option left is (money < 5)
    print("Go ask Dad for few dollars")`}
/>

Or if you want to go outside only either when it's not raining, or when there's free hotdogs at the store:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`raining = True
free_hotdogs = False

if ((not raining) or (free_hotdogs)):
    print("Let's go")
else:
    print("Not today")`}
/>

> Note: In Python, you can compare boolean variables to True implicitly without the comparison operators (e.g. `if (a)` equals `if (a == True)`,
`if (not a)` equals `if (a == False)`).

# Conditional Shortcut

One last thing before we go. There are scenarios in Python where you want to assign a variable a different value depending on some conditions. Normally,
you'll have to do something like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`if (raining):
    umbrella = True
else:
    umbrella = False`}
/>

Notice how a simple assignment takes 4 lines? This is really annoying if you have multiple of these in your program, not to mention the low readability.

Luckily, there is a shorter way to write these statements:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`umbrella = True if (raining) else False`}
/>

Here, the `if`-statement will check the condition, and if it's true, return the value before the `if`. If not, the value after the `else` is return.

However, you might notice that this solution isn't really the best looking one. That's the same reaction most Python developers have when seeing this for
the first time. A lot of them, therefore, discourage using these shortcut statements. Personally, I'd say you can do whatever you want (or more importantly,
what your boss/tutor wants).

If you're looking for alternatives, take a look at <Redirect name="this" url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394809/does-python-have-a-ternary-conditional-operator" />
Stack Overflow post. Some advanced Python users don't like any of these suggestions though, so use them sparringly.

# Conclusion

And that's the conditionals done! Next week we will take a look at loops, a concept that is strongly based on the boolean values we discussed above, so
please make sure to understand it thoroughly.
