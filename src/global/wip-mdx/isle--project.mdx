# Integrated Self Learning Environment

I.S.L.E. (Integrated Self Learning Environment) is an idle fishing game built on the browser. The game is simple: spend time studying with the game open to
catch fish. The longer you are focused, the more fish you can get. But be careful, since getting distracted will pause the fishing timer, as well as
blocking you from fishing for a while!

The game has all the tools to keep you focused: in-game songs, simplistic graphics, as well as a dedicated FOCUSED mode. Try it out today
[here](https://isle-210204.web.app/)!

# Gameplay

The game is designed with minimized gameplay to help you focus on your work. For every 15 minutes you spend in the game window, you will catch a random
fish. Every fish has its own visuals, rarity, and story. Fish can be any of four rarities: COMMON, RARE, EPIC, or LEGENDARY. As you catch more fish, your
Fish Score will increase, unlocking new fishing rods and increasing your chance of catching rarer fish. Catching the same fish multiple times will increase
its level, further increasing your Fish Score. Try to catch as many fish as you can!

There are two gamemodes: RELAXED and FOCUSED. Fishing in RELAXED mode takes the normal 15 minutes, but you gain double speed when paying attention
for 5 conscutive minutes. Losing focus returns back to normal speed. Fishing in FOCUSED mode is always in double speed, but losing focus will pause your
fishing timer for 5 minutes, meaning you cannot change windows will in this mode. Depending on your work and how commited you need to be, choose the mode
that fits you the most!

Keep your progress by logging in with Google! You will also gain access to a Journal, helping keep track your every day progress as well as notes for the
day.

# Visuals

All the sprites in the games are done by me, using Aseprite. Similar to T.A.G., I try to keep the graphics simple using only using only black and white
colors, but this time allowing players to change to color of the entire screen using the Colors tab (there's even an RGB mode).

The game is given a simplistic design to reduce the amount of on-screen distractions: an isle with an person (you!) fishing, whose rod can be changed.
A toggleable fishing timer tells you how much time is left until your next fish, as well as buttons to the sides of the screen for accessing different
menus. The buttons and timers can be hidden in the settings.

The gae is designed to be responsive for different screen resolutions. Give it a try on your PC or mobile browser!

# Audio

All the songs and audio in the game was made by my friend HFuc. Check out his YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@_hfucmusific.)!

# Development

The game was made using the simple stack of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with hosting and storage using Firebase.
