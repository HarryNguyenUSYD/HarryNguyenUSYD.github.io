# Welcome Back (0)

Hello and welcome to the fifth episode of our "Absolute Basics" series, where we are talking about everything you need to know to write your first programs
using Python. This week, we will talk about loops, the most basic method of repeating your work not only in Python but also in most programming languages.

Today's topic will make use of conditionals and boolean statements as we have discussed last week. For a quick refresher on that, check last week's blog out
<Redirect name="here" url="/blogs/programming-4" />.

So, without further ado, let's get right into loops!

# Welcome Back (1)

Take a look at this function, which prints the same string 3 times in a row, with a number that increases by one each time, like some sort of counter:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def printManyTimes():
    print("Printing line 1!")
    print("Printing line 2!")
    print("Printing line 3!")`}
/>

Now let's say we want to increase from printing 3 times to 5 times. Sure, we can just copy and paste the print statements, as well as changing some numbers.
That's not too difficult with modern computers, right?

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def printManyTimes():
    print("Printing line 1!")
    print("Printing line 2!")
    print("Printing line 3!")
    print("Printing line 4!")
    print("Printing line 5!")`}
/>

But what if we want to increase the number to 10 times? 100 times? 1000 times? Every print statement is slightly different from each other, so we have
to manually change each of them (and don't you dare miscount once!). Surely there's a better way than that, right?

This is where loops come in. Loops are powerful tools that allows us to repeat our actions in code. Instead of copy-pasting statements a hundred times
to do something, loops reduce that to just a few lines. This increases productivity, readability, and is simply much more satisfying to make.

One type of loops Python offers is the `for`-loop, which can be used like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`for <variable> in range(<count>):
    # Do something`}
/>

Here, we combine the `for`-loop with the `range` function, allowing us to repeat the code inside `<count>` number of times (if `<count>` is 3, the code
will repeat 3 times). `<variable>` is a variable we use to loop. Indexing in Python starts from 0, so `<variable>` will have value 0 in loop 1, 1 in loop 2,
and so on. For instance, we can modify our function above to something like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def printManyTimes():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Printing line {i + 1}!")`}
/>

> Note: Notice the strange string syntax? Those are called f-strings, or format strings. These are very useful if you want to put variables in the middle
of your strings. You can take a look at them in detail <Redirect name="here" url="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_string_formatting.asp" />.

This function does exactly the same thing, but much much sorter and cleaner than the old one. More importantly, this implementation lets us increase the
number of iterations by changing the number in the `range` function. So now, if I want to change to 1000 times:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def printManyTimes():
    for i in range(1000): # Change from 5 to 1000
        print(f"Printing line {i + 1}!")`}
/>

That's it! Much better, right?

Another useful aspect of loops is the ability to repeat code an unknown number of times. Let's say we only want the user to decide the number of times to
print that line. A user can type in a number anywhere from 0 to infinity, making it impossible to put print statements in preparation (we will not talk
about invalid inputs in this example).

To add the ability to take inputs, we can modify our function like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def printManyTimes():
    count = int(input("How many iterations do you want? "))

    # A simple check in case the user wants to type in something negative
    if (count < 0):
        count = 0

    for i in range(count):
        print(f"Printing line {i + 1}!")`}
/>

Now, we can dynamically print as many lines as the user wants. Try it on your computer!

# Welcome Back (2)

Another common loop we can use in Python is called a `while`-loop. This loop is similar to the `for`-loop, but much more useful for when we can't tell
beforehand how many iterations will be called.

`while`-loops can be made like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`while (<condition>):
    # Do something`}
/>

Looks simple, right? `<condition>` are boolean statements, the same ones we use for conditionals (like `if`-statements). `while`-loops will continously
run until `<condition>` becomes `False`, meaning we can run the loop as long as it needs to.

We can modify the function we have above using the `while`-loop like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def printManyTimes():
    count = int(input("How many iterations do you want? "))

    # A simple check in case the user wants to type in something negative
    if (count < 0):
        count = 0

    # While loop instead!
    i = 0
    while (i < count): # Condition
        print(f"Printing line {i + 1}!")
        
        i += 1 # This line is important!`}
/>

Notice the `i += 1` at the end? Unlike `for`-loops, `while`-loops need a way of changing the condition as it iterates. In other words, we have to contruct
the loop in such a way that `<condition>` will become `False` at some point. Failing to do so, and you might end up with something known as an infinite loop.

Suppose we remove the last line from the function:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def printManyTimes():
    count = int(input("How many iterations do you want? "))

    # A simple check in case the user wants to type in something negative
    if (count < 0):
        count = 0

    # While loop instead!
    i = 0
    while (i < count): # Condition
        print(f"Printing line {i + 1}!")
        
        # Uh oh...`}
/>

And then we run this function. What will happen is that the function will run infinitely (if the input is greater than 0). Since the condition of the `while`-loop
is always satisfied, the loop will not break by itself. Your program will print the lines infinitely!

> Note: If you accidentally made one of these and run it, you can forcefully stop the program by hitting Ctrl + C (Cmd + C for Mac). This will interrupt
the program and quit it.

Like mentioned earlier, `while`-loops are useful when we don't know in advance how many iterations will be called. An example of this is the Collatz
Conjecture. Given a positive integer `n`, we do one of two things:

- If `n` is odd, we multiply it by 3, then add 1.
- If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.

We repeat this until we hit the number 1, since after that the number will be stuck in a loop 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.
A Python implementation of solving a number would be something like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="python"
    copiable={true}
    code={`def collatzSolve(n: int):
    while (n != 1):
        print(n)

        if (n % 2 == 0): # n is even
            n = n / 2
        else: # n is odd
            n = 3 * n + 1`}
/>

Since `n` can be bigger or smaller after each iteration, it's impossible to tell if we are approaching `n == 1` or not.

> Note: Try to run the function with any positive number. If a number causes the function to go infinite, you might have had disproved the Collatz
Conjecture!
