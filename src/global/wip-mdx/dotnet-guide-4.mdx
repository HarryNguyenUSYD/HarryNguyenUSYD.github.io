# Welcome Back!

Hello and welcome to the latest episode of my series on .NET. Last week we tackled some of the basic topics about C#, such as simple I/O, variable types, and
operators (read it <Redirect name="here" url="/blogs/dotnet-guide-3"/>!). Today we will use those topics to talk about conditionals and loops, as well as some keywords relating to them. These topics will be useful
for writing more complex programs using C#, which will transfer nicely into our goal of making .NET projects.

Without further ado, let's get into it!

# "Go To The Store And Buy A Bottle Of Milk. If They Have Eggs, Buy 12."

Conditionals are ways to tell the program to do different things depending on its state. In C#, that revolves around three main keywords: `if`, `else`,
and `switch`.

`if` is the simplest: do something if true. Typically, that "something" is either a boolean variable, or an expression that resolves to a boolean value.

We can make an `if`-statement using this syntax:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`if (<expression>) {
    // Do something
}`}
/>

> Note: Oh, notice the `//` in that code snippet? Typing that allows you to write comments, essentially text that aren't considered to be
part of the code. Use that to make your code clearer.

Occasionally, you might want to do something if a condition is met, but do something **else** otherwise. That's where the `else` keyword comes in. `else`
extends the `if` statement to do some other things when the condition returns `false`.

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`if (<expression>) {
    // Do something
} else {
    // Do some other thing
}`}
/>

You can stack multiple `else` statements in a row by writing what's known as `else if` statements. This is helpful if you want to do something differently
depending on what condition is met (e.g. return 1 if true, 0 if false, -1 if there was an error).

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`if (<expression_1>) {
    // Do something
} else if (<expression_2>) {
    // Do some other thing
} else {
    // Do some final thing
}`}
/>

Let's make an example. Say you are writing a program that, depending on their age, prints out the group a user belongs to. They are `Children` if their age
is lower than 12, `Teenagers` if they are between 12 and 18, and `Adults` if they are older or equal to 18. A conditional statement for that would
look something like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`string? input = Console.ReadLine();

int age = Convert.ToInt32(input);
if (age < 12) {
    Console.WriteLine("You are in group Children!");
} else if (age >= 12 && age < 18) {
    Console.WriteLine("You are in group Teenagers!");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("You are in group Adults!");
}`}
/>

Another way we can check for multiple conditions is using the `switch` statement. `switch` statements are cleaner, have better readability and has access
to some cool features from C# 7+. However, it only works when all of your conditions revolve around one variable.

We can write a `switch` statement like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`switch (<variable>) {
    case <value_1>:
        // Do something
        break;
    case <value_2>:
        // Do something
        break;
    // Some other cases here...
    default:
        // Do something
        break;
}`}
/>

`switch` statements do something different depending on which `case` the variable belongs to. There can be as many cases as there are possible values of
the variable. If you want to make a "catch-all" case that all the other cases may miss, use the `default` keyword (as seen above).

As an example, say you want to print out a greeting message depending on the type of the user:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`string? input = Console.ReadLine();

switch (input) {
    case "admin":
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome, Admin!");
        break;
    case "member":
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome, Member!");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid user!");
        break;
}`}
/>

Here, the program will print `Welcome, Admin!` if you typed in "admin", and print `Welcome, Member!` if you typed in "member". If you typed in anything
else though, it will print out `Invalid user!` instead.

Also, notice how there is a `break` keyword at the end of each case? `break` is used when you need to end a case in a `switch` statement. Without that
keyword, C# will throw a compile-time error. The only time you can remove it is when the case is empty (known as label grouping), essentially
combine multiple cases into one. For instance:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`string? input = Console.ReadLine();

int number = Convert.ToInt32(input);
switch (number) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Case 1 and 2");
        break;
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("Case 3");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Neither 1, 2, or 3");
        break;
}`}
/>

Here, if you type in either 1 or 2, the program will print out `Case 1 and 2`.

> What will happen if you type in 3? What if you typed in another number?

Finally, just a quick reminder before our next section: you can use logical operators (`&&` and `||`) in `if` and `if-else` statements to combine multiple
conditions in one statement (e.g. `if (a == 1 || a == 2)` will trigger if `a` equals 1 or 2), but this doesn't work in `switch` statements!

Loops are ways that a program can repeat the same actions multiple times. Loops in `C#` falls into three types: `for`, `while`, and `foreach`-loops.

`for`-loops in C# are the same as the ones in Java or C/C++. For those who don't know, they work following this structure:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`for (<statement_1>; <statement_2>; <statement_3>) {
    // Do something
}`}
/>

- `<statement_1>`: executed once when the loop begins (sort of like initializing the loop).
- `<statement_2>`: condition for the loop to run (checked after executing `<statement_3>`), stop the loop if this returns `false`.
- `<statement_3>`: executed once every loop cycle (repeat this at the end of each cycle).

That might sound complex, but it will be much easier to understand using an example:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine("Loop with i = " + i);
}`}
/>

The result will be:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`Loop with i = 0
Loop with i = 1
Loop with i = 2
Loop with i = 3
Loop with i = 4
Loop with i = 5
Loop with i = 6
Loop with i = 7
Loop with i = 8
Loop with i = 9`}
/>

As you can see, the loop starts by declaring a variable `int i = 0`. The loop then repeat itself, calling `i++` at the end of each step (`i++` means
increment `i` by 1 every call) until `i < 10` is no longer true. This is why you can see the program print
out values `i` from 0 to 9, but not 10, since the loop ends when `i` is greater or equal to 10.

`for`-loops are the best when you know roughly how many times the loop will run. They have great readability and is much easier to implement
than our next loop: `while`-loops.

`while`-loops are again similar to the ones in Java and C/C++. They work like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`while (<condition>) {
    // Do something    
}`}
/>

`while`-loops will simply do something while the condition is true. Take a look at this code:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`int i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
    Console.WriteLine("Loop with i = " + i);
    i++; // Try removing this line
}`}
/>

Here, the program prints out the values of `i` from 0 to 9, just like the `for`-loop. Unlike the `for`-loop, however, you have to declare the variables before
the loop begins, and the increment within the loop.

But what if you remove the `i++` line? You will find that the loop goes on forever, printing `Loop with i = 0` each time.

> Note: If you are stuck in an infinite loop, press `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` for Mac users) on the terminal. This will interrupt and end the program.

`while`-loops are easier to implement and work better than `for`-loops in many scenarios, but they come with reduced readability and risk of creating infinite
loops. These are often really hard to debug (your program might randomly freeze without you knowing!), so make sure to add the increment step in
the loop.

Finally, we have `foreach`-loops. `foreach`-loops are rarer among programming languages (they don't exist in C, and they share the same keywords as `for`-loops
in C++ and Java), but they are one of the more useful loops in OOP languages such as C#. `foreach`-loops are used to traverse over a list, an array,
or other iterable data structures. We will tackle this loop next week when we discuss arrays and other common data structures in C#.

# Breaking and... Continuing?

There are two keywords that are really useful in loops: `break` and `continue`.

You may remember `break` as the keyword in `switch` statements as mentioned above. In loops, however, it comes with the purpose of stopping the loop early.
This is useful if you have met the exit condition early, or if there is an exception you want to catch. Take a look at this loop:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        Console.WriteLine("Early exit");
        break;
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Loop with i = " + i);
}`}
/>

The output will be:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`Loop with i = 0
Loop with i = 1
Loop with i = 2
Loop with i = 3
Loop with i = 4
Early exit`}
/>

The loop repeat until it gets to `i == 5`. Although the looping condition is still true, the loop exits early due to the `break` keyword.

`continue` is similar to `break`, but instead of skipping the rest of the loop, it just skips over this iteration. For instance, if we replace `break` with
`continue` on the code above:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        Console.WriteLine("Skipped");
        continue;
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Loop with i = " + i);
}`}
/>

The output will be:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`Loop with i = 0
Loop with i = 1
Loop with i = 2
Loop with i = 3
Loop with i = 4
Skipped
Loop with i = 6
Loop with i = 7
Loop with i = 8
Loop with i = 9`}
/>

`continue` is useful for the same reason as `break`, but in some different scenarios.

While both of these keywords are great in loops, it is often recommended not to use them often, as they significantly reduce code readability and make
code maintenance much more difficult. Make sure to use them wisely.
