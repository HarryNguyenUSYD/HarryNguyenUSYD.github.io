# Welcome Back!

Hello everyone to the latest episode of my series on .NET. Last week we tackled some of the basic topics about C#, such as simple I/O, variable types, and
operators (read it <Redirect name="here" url="/blogs/dotnet-guide-3"/>!). Today we will use those topics to talk about conditionals and loops, as well as some keywords relating to them. These topics will be useful
for writing more complex programs using C#, which will transfer nicely into our goal of making .NET projects.

Without further ado, let's get into it!

# Conditionals

Conditionals in C# revolve around three main keywords: `if`, `else`, and `switch`.

`if` is the simplest: do something if true. Typically, that "something" is either a boolean variable, or an expression that resolves to a boolean value.

We can make an `if`-statement using this syntax:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`if (<expression>) {
    // Do something
}`}
/>

> Note: Oh, notice the `//` in that code snippet? Typing that allows you to write comments, essentially text that aren't considered to be
part of the code. Use that to make your code clearer.

Occasionally, you might want to do something if a condition is met, but do something **else** otherwise. That's where the `else` keyword comes in. `else`
extends the `if` statement to do some other things when the condition returns `false`.

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`if (<expression>) {
    // Do something
} else {
    // Do some other thing
}`}
/>

You can stack multiple `else` statements in a row by writing what's known as `else if` statements. This is helpful if you want to do something differently
depending on what condition is met (e.g. return 1 if true, 0 if false, -1 if there was an error).

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`if (<expression_1>) {
    // Do something
} else if (<expression_2>) {
    // Do some other thing
} else {
    // Do some final thing
}`}
/>

Let's make an example. Say you are writing a program that, depending on their age, prints out the group a user belongs to. They are `Children` if their age
is lower than 12, `Teenagers` if they are between 12 and 18, and `Adults` if they are older or equal to 18. A conditional statement for that would
look something like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    copiable={true}
    code={`string? input = Console.ReadLine();

int age = Convert.ToInt32(input);
if (age < 12) {
    Console.WriteLine("You are in group Children!");
} else if (age >= 12 && age < 18) {
    Console.WriteLine("You are in group Teenagers!");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("You are in group Adults!");
}`}
/>

Another way we can check for multiple conditions is using the `switch` statement. `switch` statements are cleaner, has better readability and has access
to some cool features from C# 7+. However, it only works when all of your conditions revolve around one variable.

We can write a `switch` statement like this:

<CodeBlock
    language="csharp"
    code={`switch (<variable>) {
    case <value_1>:
        // Do something
        break;
    case <value_2>:
        // Do something
        break;
    // Some other cases here...
    default:
        // Do something
        break;
}`}
/>

`switch` statements can have as many cases as there are possible values of the variable. If you want to make a "catch-all" case that all the other cases may
miss, use the `default` keyword (as seen above).

Also, notice how at the end of each case there is a `break` keyword? `break` is used when you need to end a case in a `switch` statement. C# will not compile
if you don't do that, so make sure to include it in each case.
