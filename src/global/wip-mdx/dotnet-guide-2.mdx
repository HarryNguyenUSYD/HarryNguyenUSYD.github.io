# The .NET SDK

Everything you need to begin using .NET has been neatly packed into a tool box called the .NET Software Development Kit (.NET SDK). As discussed during
<Redirect name='episode 1' url='/blogs/dotnet-guide-1' />, the SDK contains core tools and programs for every .NET project, including compilers,
the <Code>dotnet</Code> driver, .NET CLI, etc. You can download the SDK from Microsoft's website
