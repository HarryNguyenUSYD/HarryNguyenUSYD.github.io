# Welcome Back!

Welcome to the second instalment of my "Introduction to .NET" series. In this episode, we will be discussing how to get started with your first .NET project.
This includes installation, file structures, initiating the base project, and how to make your first changes.

If you want to know more about the history of .NET, its structure and why you should use it, check out the previous episode

# The First Step

Everything you need to begin using .NET has been neatly packed into a tool box called the .NET Software Development Kit (.NET SDK). As discussed during
<Redirect name='episode 1' url='/blogs/dotnet-guide-1' />, the SDK contains core tools and programs for every .NET project, including compilers,
the `dotnet` driver, .NET CLI, etc. You can download the SDK from Microsoft's website
<Redirect name='here' url='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet' />.

Once on the website, click the highlighted link to download the newest active version. .NET is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Pick a version that
matches your device.

> Note: For this series, we will be using the .NET 9 Windows version.

Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on it to begin. Click on the **Install** button and simply wait for the installation to complete.
Congratulations, you have successfully downloaded .NET to your machine (thus beginning an era of suffering)!

# Hello, World!

Create an empty directory and open it with your favorite code editor or IDEs. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are strongly suggested,
since they are developed by Microsoft to be fully integrated with .NET projects, but other tools such as JetBrains Rider can also be used.

> Note: For this series, we will be using VS Code.

Open the terminal. Use the command:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code="dotnet new console -o sample" />

...to create a new sample project. You will see a directory named `sample` in your workspace, consisting of:

- `obj/`: Contains the intermediary "object" files and generated MSBuild artefacts produced during compilation.
- `Program.cs`:	Holds the top-level statements. This is the entry point of your project.
- `sample.csproj`: An SDK-style project file that tells MSBuild you are building an executable for the latest .NET target.

> Reminder: MSBuild is the .NET projects' build system. It's used to compile source code, generate binaries, and manage the entire build pipeline.
