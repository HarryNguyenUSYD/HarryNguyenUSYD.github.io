# Introduction

Hello there, and welcome to my website!

Here I will upload some of my projects that I have been working on, as well as some blogs that will hopefully show some insights on what I am currently doing.

You can get notified of these updates by following me on Linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoang-quan-nguyen-304705266/).

# Blogs

I will try to post blogs as often as I can. Being a full-time student, I have to balance between study, work, and life, so please expect around 1-2 post(s) per week.

To search for blogs, you can use the search bar, but you can also search by tags by clicking on them. Posts can be sorted by newest, oldest, most liked, or most viewed.

All blogs can be liked and shared, so if you want to support me, please do both of them. I keep track of the number of views and likes, and seeing the numbers go up motivate me a lot.

# Finally

Thank you for using my website! I hope you will learn something new here.
